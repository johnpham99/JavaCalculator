# JavaCalculator
Simple Calculator Program made in Java

## General Info / Introduction
I wanted to have more experience creating Java GUIs, and I thought a basic calculator would be a great place to start. My previous GUI projects/assignments utilized JavaFX, so this was my first time using Swing.

## Technologies
This project uses:
 * Java
 * Java Swing
 * Java AWT

## Screenshots

## Setup
To run this project, simply compile and run one of the Calculator files in the src folder.

## Status
This project is not yet complete.
In the future, I plan on implementing:
 * Output formattimg
 * An image/logo
 * Sound Effects
 * Calculations that utilize more than 2 numbers

## Source / Inspiration
This program is inspired by this tutorial: https://youtu.be/dfhmTyRTCSQ
